Description:<br>
"SWIGGY is India's leading e-commerce platform for online food ordering. A comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze Swiggy's customer funnel performance. The project focuses on key metrics such as website traffic, its sources, total orders, conversion rates including stage-wise conversion like List to Menu, Menu to Cart, Cart to Payment and Payment to Order, metrics affecting each conversion stages like count of restaurants, average delivery charges, average packaging charges, payment success rate, etc, and comparative insights (current day vs. same day last week). Features include interactive visualizations, actionable KPIs, and advanced data transformations for meaningful insights."<br>

Key Features:<br>
1. Funnel analysis showing customer journey from Menu to Order stage and overall conversion with percent conversion at each stage.<br>
3. Comparative analysis of funnel stages(today vs. same day last week).<br>
4. Insights into traffic sources (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc.).<br>
5. Comparative analysis of restaurant performance (today vs. same day last week).<br>
6. Clean and interactive visuals for easy data interpretation.<br>
7. Advanced data cleaning and transformation using Power BI's Power Query Editor.<br>

Sample Insights description -
For example - On June 20th, Traffic coming on website was 10 Million, from which Orders received was 0.62 Million, and hence conversion rate is 6.0%. Now, we compare this with same day last week, where Total Order last week was 1.35 Million so you can notice a drop of total orders by 0.73M. Now, Orders can either drop due to fluctuation in traffic coming to website, and if good traffic comes to website, there might be no good conversion of customers. In this case on 20th June, (check Traffic & Sources Analysis report of PowerBi), you notice compared to same day last week, traffic coming drastically decreased via all sources like Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, Others. Also (refer Stage wise Conversion report) conversion dropped at List to Menu, Cart to Payment and Payment to Order stage, while Menu to Cart looks stable. Now to check why these ratios dropped, (refer L2M & M2C Metrics, M2C & C2P Metrics reports), for L2M drop, notice, Number of Restaurants has dropped by 26.65K, similary for C2P notice Average Packaging Charges have increased by 2 units and so there might be drop at cart to payment stage.
